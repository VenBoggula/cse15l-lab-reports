Issue with Calculations in Java Program

Hello,
I'm currently working on a Java program for my class project, and I've run into a strange issue. I've attached a screenshot below that shows the problem. The program is supposed to calculate the average of an array of numbers, but it seems like the result is way off. I've double-checked my code, and I can't figure out what's going wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
