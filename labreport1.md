Nothing happened because cd changes directory but since we put no argument, it takes you to the home directory and we are already in the home directory.

It takes it to the lecture 1 directory because we put lecture 1 as the arguemnt, it worked as intended.

It produces an error because the cd command only takes you to a new directory, so if you put a file as an argument instead it results in an error.

When the command ls is run with no argument it produces lecture 1. The ls commnand outputs the names of files and folers within the current directory so when you are in the home directory within the terminal it will produce lecture 1 as that is the only directory availabe.

It produces that output because that is the files within the lecture 1 directory and the ls command prints out all the files within the current directory which is lecture 1.
