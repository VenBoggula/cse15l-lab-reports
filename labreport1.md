Nothing happened because cd changes directory but since we put no argument, it takes you to the home directory and we are already in the home directory.

It takes it to the lecture 1 directory because we put lecture 1 as the arguemnt, it worked as intended.

It produces an error because the cd command only takes you to a new directory, so if you put a file as an argument instead it results in an error.
