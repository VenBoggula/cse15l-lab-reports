The stringhandler and handleRequestare the methods called in my code. 
The relevant methods are handleRequest(URI url) in the StringHandler class and the main(String[] args) method in the StringServer class.
In the StringHandler class, the relevant fields are stringBuilder and messageCount, which store the accumulated messages and the count of messages, respectively. The handleRequest method takes a URI object as an argument, allowing it to extract information from the incoming URL. The StringServer class mainly processes command line arguments but doesn't maintain any relevant fields for this specific functionality.

Something that I learned in this week's lab was about directories and creating keys. I was pretty interested in the mkdir commands for the terminal as I didn't know that you could tranfer files between different systems. It was pretty cool how you could log in the terminal without using a password.
